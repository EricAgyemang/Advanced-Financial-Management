# PROJECT

# VALUATION PROJECT: COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION

# SUMMARY
Costco Wholesale Corporation is members-only warehouse store, selling a variety of
merchandise. In this report, we conducted a valuation of Costco stock and assessed whether to
sell, hold or buy their stock. Using the discounted cash flow estimation method, our valuation
resulted in a share price of $193.532. This estimated share price is significantly lower than
Costco’s share price of $301.33. (Retrieved April 22, 2020 from https://www.msn.com/enus/money/stockdetails/fi-a1q6k2).
The initial decision was to sell but using the 40%
discrepancy, a percentage change of 35.7740654% was obtained. This value is less than 40%,
indicating that instead of selling. We then run a sensitivity analysis of
two key factors (terminal growth rate and expected return) that drove the valuation to assess
effects on the estimated share price. Based on our valuation and the results of our sensitivity
analysis, majority confirmed holding Costco stock.

# DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
  # Sales Model
Typical Costco Warehouses carry only 3700 distinct products, compared to Walmart, who
carry approximately 140,000 products. Costco does not stock products whose wholesale price
they feel is too high. (“Costco,” n.d., para. 12). Such an incidence occurred in 2009, when
Costco refused to sell Coca Cola products mainly because of the need to give consumers lowest
prices possible in order to compete with other companies like Walmart.

 # Products
Costco has an inventory that changes often. The company is renowned for carrying products
temporarily and then later converting them into seasonal products. Initially selling only boxed
items, it has gradually expanded its range of products and services; it now sells many more
difficult-to-handle products such as caskets, clothing, computer software, home appliances and
perishable food such as dairy, meat and sea food. Many Warehouses have gas stations and
pharmacies. (“Costco,” n.d., para 16).

# Services
Costco offers a wide variety of services, apart from mainly food services. It offers Concierge
Services to members who purchase electronic gadgets to help them understand how to use
products to avoid the potential situation of returning something they have bought. (“Costco,”
n.d., para 21) Costco has an auto program, where it teams up with various auto manufacturers
to offer special deals to customers. As of September 2015, Costco was the second largest auto
seller in the US after AutoNation. (“Costco,” n.d., para 24). Costco has an optical company,
Costco Optical, which was the 5th largest optical company in the US as of 2015. (“Costco,”
n.d., para 26).

# BRIEF HISTORY OF COSTCO
Costco Wholesale Corporation is an American Corporation which operates a chain of
membership-only Warehouse Clubs. As of 2016, it was the world’s largest retailer of choice
and prime beef, organic food, Rotisserie chicken and wine. (“Costco,” n.d., para 1).
The beginnings of Costco could be traced to as far back as 1976, when Sol Price, together with
his son, nephew and others found the Price Club. It’s first location was in a converted airplane
hangar on Moreno Boulevard in San Diego. Price Club was originally limited to serving only
small businesses; members who could purchase a wide range of supplies and wholesale items.
James Sinegal, a protégé of Sol Price transformed the Price Club by introducing strategies for
expansion to a select audience of non-business members. In 1983, James Sinegal along with
Seattle retailer James Brotman founded Costco Wholesale which run independently of Price
Club but for the next 10 years, both companies continued to innovate and grow until 1993,
when both companies decided to merge operations due to growing competition from Walmart.
The merged company became known as Price Costco.
Price Costco membership became Universal, had 206 locations, and generated $16 billion in
sales annually. In 1997, Price Costco was rebranded Costco Wholesale Corporation, 3 years
after the Price brothers left the company to form Price Enterprises, a warehouse club chain in
Central America and the Caribbean. In 2019, Costco was ranked 14th on the Fortune 500
rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue. (“Costco,” n.d., para 5).
